            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Enforcement Rights: </b>PollRepo upholds the right to enforce
              our Terms actively. This includes managing content, user accounts,

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Personal Content Licensing: </b>When you share individual
              content on PollRepo, including opinions, insights, or any media,
              you retain full ownership of your contributions. By participating,
              you grant PollRepo a broad, royalty-free license to distribute
              your content globally, enabling us to share your insights with a
              wider audience. In exchange, PollRepo grants you a license to

              fully engage with and benefit from the PollRepo community. This
              mutual exchange ensures your content can reach beyond its original
              confines, contributing to a diverse global dialogue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Collaborative Polls - A Community Endeavor: </b>Collaborative
              polls on PollRepo embody our commitment to communal knowledge and
              collective insight. Unlike personal content, contributions to
              collaborative polls are governed by a shared licensing model.{" "}
              <b>This Means: </b>
            </li>

            <li>
              While you initiate contributions to collaborative polls and retain
              a form of primary ownership, these polls are open to edits,
              modifications, and enhancements by both PollRepo and the community
              at large. Contributions to collaborative polls are licensed under
              a free and open license, reflecting our ethos of shared knowledge
              and community collaboration. This framework ensures that your
              contribution, while originating from you, become integral to a
              larger pool of community wisdom.
            </li>

            <li>
              In keeping with the spirit of community collaboration, you
              acknowledge that collaborative polls are not subject to individual
              deletion rights. Once contributed, these polls exist for the
              community's benefit, allowing for a dynamic and evolving
              exploration of collective opinions and insights.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Nature of Content: </b>It's important to note that the content
              on PollRepo, including contributions to collaborative polls,
              represents a spectrum of user opinions and perspectives. This
              content is not intended to serve as professional advice or factual
              representation but as a reflection of diverse viewpoints and
              experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Service Usage: </b>PollRepo operates "AS IS," offering a
              dynamic platform for community engagement. While we strive for
              accuracy and reliability, the open nature of content contribution
              means users may encounter various opinions and discussions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Liabilities and Remedies: </b>You may discontinue your use of
              PollRepo at any time. Our responsibility for damages is limited,
              focusing on fostering an environment where open dialogue thrives.
              PollRepo is a space for opinion sharing, and as such, content
              should be viewed as reflective of individual perspectives rather
              than authoritative advice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Our Mission: </b>PollRepo's core mission is to cultivate a
              space where opinions can be shared, debated, and understood in a
              collective context. Our platform is built on the principle of
              community-driven exploration, allowing for a rich tapestry of
              insights to emerge from the collective input of our users.

                  If any provision of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, it
